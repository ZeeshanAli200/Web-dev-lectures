        <p class="paraStyle">There was once a velveteen rabbit, and in the beginning he was really splendid. He
            was fat and bunchy, as a rabbit should be; his coat was spotted brown and white, he had real thread
            whiskers, and his ears were lined with pink sateen. On Christmas morning, when he sat wedged in the top of
            the Boy’s stocking, with a sprig of holly between his paws, the effect was charming. <br><br>

            There were other things in the stocking, nuts and oranges and a toy engine, and chocolate almonds and a
            clockwork mouse, but the Rabbit was quite the best of all. For at least two hours the Boy loved him, and
            then Aunts and Uncles came to dinner, and there was a great rustling of tissue paper and unwrapping of
            parcels, and in the excitement of looking at all the new presents the Velveteen Rabbit was forgotten.
            <br><br>

            For a long time he lived in the toy cupboard or on the nursery floor, and no one thought very much about
            him. He was naturally shy, and being only made of velveteen, some of the more expensive toys quite snubbed
            him. The mechanical toys were very superior, and looked down upon every one else; they were full of modern
            ideas, and pretended they were real. The model boat, who had lived through two seasons and lost most of his
            paint, caught the tone from them and never missed an opportunity of referring to his rigging in technical
            terms. The Rabbit could not claim to be a model of anything, for he didn’t know that real rabbits existed;
            he thought they were all stuffed with sawdust like himself, and he understood that sawdust was quite
            out-of-date and should never be mentioned in modern circles. Even Timothy, the jointed wooden lion, who was
            made by the disabled soldiers, and should have had broader views, put on airs and pretended he was connected
            with Government. Between them all the poor little Rabbit was made to feel himself very insignificant and
            commonplace, and the only person who was kind to him at all was the Skin Horse.<br> </p>
